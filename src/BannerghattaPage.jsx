      <p className="page-description">
        Bannerghatta Forest, located near Bangalore in Karnataka, is known for its rich biodiversity and conservation efforts. 
        Established as a national park in 1974, it later expanded to include the famous Bannerghatta Biological Park. The forest 
        is home to a wide variety of animals, including Bengal tigers, lions, elephants, and several species of deer and bears. 
        Bannerghatta is unique because it also houses a butterfly park, one of the first in India. Historically, the forest served 
        as a natural habitat close to human settlements, leading to early efforts at conservation. The terrain here is a mix of hilly 
        areas, dense scrub, and deciduous forests. It plays an important role in wildlife education, research, and eco-tourism. Being 
        so close to Bangalore, it offers a rare chance to experience wildlife without traveling far into the wilderness.
